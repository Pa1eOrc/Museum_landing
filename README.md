# Museum landing page

- A landing page was created by design, with HTML, SCSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

- The page was constructed using a display grid and SCSS mixins, ensuring proper functionality across various device widths and heights.

- Grid-item modifiers were created using SCSS functions within a 'for' loop.
